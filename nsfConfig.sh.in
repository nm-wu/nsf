# nsfConfig.sh --

# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by the Next
# Scripting configure script.  It will create shell variables for most
# of the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts for
# Next Scripting extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.  This file does not duplicate information
# already provided by tclConfig.sh, so you may need to use that file
# in addition to this one.

# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.
